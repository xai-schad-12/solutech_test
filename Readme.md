# api  BACK-END 
i have started creating the application meaning initilaizing the api and then 
configurate files like http,controller ,Database ,including migration 
Database used: pgsql
Backend:laravel framework

i have respected the architecture of database but 
what was remaining it's just a path-based route however in the front-end app i made somthing similar to this functionality.

the routes of the api were made correctly as specified in the short description given.
  # route
    1.login for admi
    2.creating event
    3.creating organizations
    4.get method of events according slug
    5.attendee method of register



  # FRONT-END
the fron-end app was made in NUXT.js with ts or typescript
the first part of the user is made correctly
with the view of 

  # organization
  # events
  # attendee subscription

all of that are pages 

but the time was not enough for me to finish this test however i did my best to show my interest 
and if you could add to me event one day i could finish the project!
with next i started creating project and creating layout and some pages as said.
